# typescript-autodoc

Automatically generate documentation and tests for Typescript and Mocha using OpenAI Codex.

This was purpose-built for the XREngine stack, but can be used anywhere. The prompts should be pretty easy to modify for your use case, even if you're not using Typescript.

## How to use
Create a config.ts in your src folder with your OpenAI keyu
Open this project, press F5 to start debug mode (unless you want to deploy as a full extension)
Press F1 > "Add TSDoc Comment With OpenAI Codex"
Press F1 > "Add Mocha Test With OpenAI Codex"

## To Do
This was quickly hacked to work for me and my team. Next steps will be to make it easy to install from marketplace and set up with an API key automatically.
Would be nice to do complete files, as well :)
